/*
tips:
- look out for int overflow and array out of bounds
- don't get stuck debugging a wrong solution, take time to think of a new one instead of spammaxg submissions
- make sure stuestion was read correctly
- for certain problems, solve a few cases by hand and try to make observations
- if behind, stop looking at leaderboard and focus on solving
